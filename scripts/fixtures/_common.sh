# Shared fixture bodies, sourced by the per-page setup scripts.
#
# Several pages document the same sample files, so a reader moving from cut to sort to uniq
# should meet the same users.csv, not three files that happen to share a name. Keeping one
# definition is what makes that true.
#
# A setup script runs inside the sandbox, where the repository isn't mounted, so it can't source
# a relative path. The harness installs this file alongside the setup script, and a page sources
# it by absolute path:
#
#     . /tmp/fixtures-common.sh
